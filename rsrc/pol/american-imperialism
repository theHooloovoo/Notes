# Notes on the Imperalistic Tendencies of the U.S.A

Client State:
  - A state that is economically, militarily or politically
    subordinate to another country.
  - Examples of client states:
    - Repulican Rome, converted defeated entities into
      client states, instead of incorporating them into the
      republic. This continued for a while, eventually
      turning the republic into an empire.
    - The Mongol's Yuan Dynasty made the Goryeo Dynasty of
      Korea a semi-autonomous client state in the 13-th
      century, lasting for 80-ish years.
    - The Soviet Union's various satellite states, such as
      Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland,
      etc.
    - The predominantly dicatorships that the U.S.A chose
      to support, such as Guatemala, El Salvador,
      Nicaruaga, Chile, etc.
    - WWII Japan's sphere of influence included conquered
      areas that were not incorperated into the empire, but
      were granted semi-autonomy. Areas include Korea,
      Manchuko, etc.

Examples:
  Pre 19th Century:
    - Well, first off, the U.S.A's land is a product of
      genocide of the Native American's.
  19th Century:
    - Manifest Destiny resulted in the systematic
      conquering of natives, in the 'Indian Wars'. Much of
      this culminated in the 'California Genocide'.
    - Mexican-American War of 1846, annexing most of the
      land from Mexico.
    - America's annexation of Hawaii in 1898.
  20th Century:
    - The Panama Canal.
      - U.S.A deliberately blocked the military of Colombia
        to allow it's internal rebelion to go unstopped.
        This resulted in the area of Panama to declare
        independance from its parent state.
      - The U.S.A promtly recognized the legitimacy of
        Panama, and being granted the rights to build the
        canal (along with infinite administration of it).
