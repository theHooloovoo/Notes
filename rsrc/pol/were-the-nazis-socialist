# Notes on a fuckin' strange topic.

Links:
  "https://mises.org/library/why-nazism-was-socialism-and-why-socialism-totalitarian":
    - Nazi Germany was a socialist state, AND not
      capitalist.
    - Socialism Requires Totalitarianism.
    - Essentially, sure private comanies existed, but they
      did what the governement told them too.
      - Therefore, the government owned the means of
        production.
      - Mises argues that price & wage controls introduced
        defacto socialism (How?).
        - I guess because they require enforcement, and
          cracking down on black markets, which is
          totalitarian (Oh fuck, does that mean that the
          war on drugs is a socialist plot from Nixon? Was
          he a secret commie too?).
      - This was "socialism on the German or Nazi pattern,
        in contrast to the more obvious socialism of the
        Soviets, which he calls socialism on the Russian
        or Bolshevik pattern."
        - The socialists must propagandize their population
          in order to maintain control. (Doesn't that go
          for literally any government?)

    - Big quote from Arnold Lunn
    - SoCiAlIsM fAiLs because everyone has a different
      picture of it, so whenever it gets done, someone
      else, goes "hey, that's fucked".

  "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/myth-busted-actually-yes-hitler-was-a-socialist-liberal/"
    - Sweet Jesus, Fuck, NO!
    - Nazis were akchually leftist (Just like the KKK, because they were founded by Democrats)
    - Nazi = National Socialist
      - Literal Quote: What does National Socialist German
        Workerâ€™s Party mean? Glad you asked. Is it
        different from "Democratic socialism"? Only in
        semantics. A Democracy is mob rule, which is why
        America is actually a constitutional,
        representative republic, NOT a democracy. A
        representative republic protects the minority from
        the majority, whereas a democracy is the rule of
        the majority. 
    - Literally compares the Holocaust to Planned
      Parenthood.
    - Claims that Hitler's policies were similar to the
      Democrats (wtf?) & he had the support of mob rule
      (But wasn't germany not a democracy Crowder?).
    - Claims that Hitler mandated the construction of the
      autobahn, and other job creation programs. These had
      the effect of putting EVERY GERMAN back to work.

Arguments Set Forth:
  - Nazi Germany was a socialist state, AND not capitalist.
  -
