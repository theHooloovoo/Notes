# Personal notes on html.
# https://codetheweb.blog

Basic Shit:	# =============================================
  - Everything is tags, and they either open or close.
    - Open:  <example>
    - Close: </example>
  - Sometimes an element doesn't need a closing tag.
    - For instance: <img src="boobs.jpg">
  - Sets of tags contain 'contents', e.g. the shit inside
    them.
    - Ex: <h1>Fuck Authority!</h1>
  - Tags may also contain 'attributes'.
    - Ex: <h1 id="Praxis" class="banner">Fuck Authority!</h1>
    - These attributes are used by CSS to style the
      document.

Structure:	# =============================================
  - Always start HTML documents with '<!DOCTYPE html>'
  - Follow that with '<html>' tags. Everything will go
    inside of that.
  
Specific Tags:	# =========================================
  <head>:
    - Stores data about the page including links to
      resources used by the page (JS, CSS, images,
      etc...)
    - The head tag doesn't display anything.
  <title>:
    - Stores the title for parent tag.
  <body>:
    - Contains stuff, I guess. ('Elaborate')
  <h{1-6}>:
    - Heading tags. The number represents the size level.
    - <h1> is the main heding (The biggest).
    - <h2> is the secondary heading (Slightly smaller).
    - ...
    - <h6> is the smallest heading
  <p>:
    - Paragraph tag. Big'ol chunk of text.
  <br>:
    - Line break. Lacks closing tag, and is not visible.
  <hr>:
    - Horizontal Rule. Like '<br>', but is a visible line.
  <!-- * -->:
    - Comment. Put your text inside.
  <img src="*">:
    - Image tag. "src" is the file path to the image.
    - Lacks closing tag.
    - Optional attributes are 'width' & 'height'.
      Parameters for these are given in pixels. (However,
      use CSS to control image sizing)
  <a href="*">:
    - Link to another webpage. ('a' stands for Anchor)
      - 'href' stands for hypertext reference.
    - Does use a closing tag, text in between is what the
      link will look like.
      - Adding a 'target="_blank"' attribute inside the
        opening '<a>' will open the link in a new tab.
    - Images can be made links by placing them inside a
      link tag.
  <div>:
    - Division tag, used to group elements.
    - Used to seperate large chunks of elements into
      logical divisions.
    - Each '<div>' tag can be given a 'CSS' to easily &
      concisely style large portions of your webpage.
    - Each '<div>' can be tactically positioned, along
      with its contents.
  <span>:
    - Used to group certain spans of text.
    - Use 'CSS' to style select sections of text.
  <li>:
    - List Item.
    - Used by '<ol>' & '<ul>' as entries to their contents.
  <ol>:
    - Ordered List.
  <ul>:
    - Unordered List.
  <dl>:
    - Definistion List.
    - Entries of composed of 'term/definition' pairs. This
      is very similar to 'key/value' pairs used by
      something like a hashmap.
    - These pairs are '<dt>' and '<dd>'.
  <nav>:
    - Navigation tag. Used by search engines (as a
      standard) to search through webistes.
    - The standard is: 'nav > ul > li > a > TEXT'
