# Notes/Ideas on a procedural planet terrain generator.

Planet:
  - Generate the Orbit, size, revolution, composition,
    etc. of the planet.
  - Techtonics
    - Generate some amount of points on the planet's
      surface.
      - Amount of points should correlate to planet size.
    - 'Crack' the surface by producing the voronoi
       cell fracture from those points.
    - Each cell is now considered a techtonic plate.
    - Find a way to simulate techtonic drift.
    - Find a way to model an atmosphere.
    - Find a way to model magnetosphere.

Surface:
  - Use layers of perlin noise for surface level features.
    - Size & Amplitude decrease be a given factor on
      a per-level basis.
  - Techtonic plates add or subtract to the surface at
    plate boundaries.
    - Plate Techtonics should scale positively with mass,
      occurence of tides, interaction with another body.
	- Vulcanism should add to the surface as well.
  - Simulate craters from asteroid impacts.
