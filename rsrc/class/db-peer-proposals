# === Entity-Relationship Diagram =============================================

Personality should have a total participation relation to Title.
  - All Personalities need to appear in at least 1 film.

Should genres/tags supposed to be seperate?
  - Also shouldn't they be a weak entity?
  - You'd want to be able to reference the genre from one tilte to that of another.

What is the location attribute on Offered_By represent?
  - I didn't see it in the desgin doc.

Maybe add a way for users to 'favorite' certain actors?
