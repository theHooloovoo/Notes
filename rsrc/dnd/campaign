    family that tries to throw a picnic blanket on him.

    called "Igra & Asri's". Although it's busy, they try

    he doesn't give him the info he wants.

    behind to seach for "Chrisanth".
  - They head down to the concierge's table, and try to
    bribe her to give the ledger to them. However, "Qrow"
    is still brandishing his sword, so she takes this a
    threat, flees, and contacts the cops.

    inside the hotel to find the floor that he's on, then
    narrow down onto two rooms where he might be.

    knife. "Qrow" snatches the knife from him.

   interupted by the sound of footsteps making their way
   up the hotel stairs.

    - "Qrow" and "Verson" run back down the stairs, to get
      their items, but not before "Qrow" returns
      "Chrisanth's" dagger and gives the business card to
      him as well.
    - "Malnor" runs back up to the 5th floor to grab his
      items, including his suit of armor. Upon getting
      them he jumps out of the window, accidentally
      cutting his belly on the smashed window.
  - "Verson" & "Qrow" push past a couple of cops, then
    meet up with "Malnor". They book it, because the cops
    are on them. Eventually "Verson", who's tired of
    carrying his suit of armor with him calls his magic
    steed and brings "Malnor" up with him. "Qrow" elects
    to split up and flee on foot.
  - "Qrow", going it alone, runs on foot for an hour or
    so, stalked by a few cops riding dienonychus's.
