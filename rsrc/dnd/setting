Fjorvek's Peak #===========================================
  - Was once the home to a Monk Temple.
  - 'Fjorvek', who in his early days was cruel and vicious,
    came to the temple to plunder it. He fought with the
    monks, but they held him back. After a few raids he
    came to respect them, seeing how they faught without
    wanting to kill. After a while he sought them out to
    converse and trade.
  - One day, the Mountain Drake "Goreasvifdrokxelme"
    climbed the peak, destroying most in his path. In the
    ensuing fight all of the monks died, except for their
    leader. "Fjorvek" helped fight off the drake, both
    nearly dying in the exchange.
  - The monk leader buried all of the bodies, then
    pertified himself, becoming a positive lich. "Fjorvek"
    now guards the temple from other would be plunderers.
