ALGOL
 - Scope Stack
 - First langauge with recursion support
 - 

COBOL
 - Designed by DoD for business applications
 - Based on flowmatic, designed by Grace Harper
 - First language to allow Record types

BASIC
 - Beginners All Purpose Instruction Code
 - Easy to learn for 'non-techies'
 - Free (As in Beer)

PL/I
 - ALGOL60 + Fortran IV + COBOL60
 - Bloated Garbage language
 - Died out in the 70's

SNOBOL
 - Text processing language

SIMULA 67
 - Provided great data abstractions
 - Introduced concept of 'Classes'

PASCAL
 - Stressed simplicity, and expressivity

C
 - Stressed flexibility
 - Became the Lingua Franca of Computer Science

Prolog
 - 70's Nonprocedural
 - Provide facts, language builds deductions from those facts

Ada
 - DoD worked seperately on over 450 languages
 - Asked for propsals from around the world
 - Based on Pascal, included packages, data abstraction
 - Extensive exception handling
 - Generic programming units
 - Concurrent execution of tasks

Objects:
  - Car  a();			// Object on the stack
  - Car* b = new Car();	// Object on the heap

  - a.model  = "Ford";	// Because stack
  - b->model = "Ford";	// Because heap

  - C/C++ are pass by value
  - Functions shouldn't pass objects:
    - by copy, becuase they are larger, take longer
    - by reference, because the object *gets destroyed* on
      function exit
  - They should pass by pointer
    - Typically create the object to be passed by
      generating it on the heap, then return it's pointer

  - All objects are given default:
    - Copy, Move constructors
    - Copy, Move operators	( operator= )
    - Destructers

  - Beware the 'Shallow Copy'
    - If 'a' contains a pointer, and you try to copy 'a'
      into 'b', then 'a' and 'b' will both point towards
      the same memory location. 'b' will not point towards
      it's own owned value.

  - Allocate/Free memory with:
    - new/delete
    - new []/delete[]	(for arrays)

=== 10/03/2018 ======================== Scope & Bindings ===

Names:
  - Names only exist for our benefit
  - Fortran had a character limit of 31
  - C technically has a char limit of 63, but the compiler doesn't care
  - Being allowed to not follow naming conventions can fuck with readability
  - Certain languages forbid the use of reserved words as variable names
  - Variables can be seen as a tuple of:
    - Name
    - Address
    - Value
    - Type
    - LifeTime
    - Scope
  - Address:
    - The Address of a variable is it's 'l-value'
    - When a single address is reffered to by more than one name, it's called an 'alias'
    - Aliases make debugging much harder to find were errors occur
  - Type:
    - determine both the range of values of a variable, and the operations that may be performed on it.
  - Value:
    - It's actually difficult to get the value out of a variable
  - Binding:
    - Occurs at language design/implementation, compile time, etc...
    - Static variables are bound at compile time.
    - In order for a binding to occur, memory needs to be allocated.
    - Dynamic variables are not bound to an address for the entirety of the programs runtime
    - Stack-Dynamic variables are variables that are statically bound but created when they are elaborated.
      - Function calls are a good example of these
      - Recursive functions would have their variables overwritten at every iteration)
